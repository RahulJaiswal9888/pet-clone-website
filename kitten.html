Exotic shorthair cats, also known as exotics, are the result of breeding a Persian with an American shorthair. If you love the look of the Persian cat but don’t want to burden yourself with the daily grooming that is required, the exotic may be the perfect cat for you. Exotic shorthair cats have the look of a Persian but with a short, plush coat that is very easy to care for.

This new breed was first developed in the 1950s in an attempt to bring the Persian’s silver color and green eyes to the American shorthair. The exotic shorthair cat was first referred to as a “Sterling” because of its silver coat color. But as more exotics were bred, other Persian coat colors began creeping in. At first the exotic shorthair cat was seen as controversial, but Persian breeders soon became intrigued with the new breed. Exotic shorthair cats were first recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1967, and today they are recognized by all cat registries.
